This repository contains my ideas which I haven't time to implement or which are uncomplete. If you want to use some of my ideas, please contact me (unless I copied the idea from somewhere else and thus shouldn't get any credit for it).

## Self-control credit cards
This idea originates from *Dan Ariely*s book *Predictably Irrational* (ISBN 978-0-06-135323-9). In [one section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational#The_Problem_of_Procrastination_and_Self-control) he talks about the idea of self-control credit cards. Those would be credit cards where you can set limits on different kinds of groups of product and can choose what happens if you exceed that limit. For example, exceeding your limit could send a message to your wife informing her about it. This way, you would be the one to choose restrictions for yourself, but it would still demotivate you to spend less. Another idea would be delaying your payments, so that when you try to make a payment, you would need to wait for a period of time, for example 30 minutes, so that you can reconsider whether you really need the thing you tried to buy. Dan Ariely tried to convince a bank to implement this idea, but after having a meeting with members of the bank, they never called him back.

Implementing self-control credit cards is difficult, because you either have to convince a bank to implement them or you need to somehow come to an agreement with some credit card manufacturer.
